# Navigational State Machine (NSM)

This directory is mostly a misnomer, as it stores the lanetracking OpenCV code, whereas the NSM itself is a system-wide state machine that is emergently implemented by the interactions of the different subsytems.

## Disclaimer

The OpenCV code is mostly generated by Claude Code, including the CMake scripts. I claim no ownership of the C++ slop in this repo.

## Rationale

The C++ programming language is a huge beast. On-ramping with an agent minimizes the time to get up to speed with the syntax and peculiarities of the language. Keeping the business logic simple and with careful conservative prompting keeps the LLM slop tractable at the very least when the debugging needs to be done manually.

If OpenCV was a Rust library, I would've written the code by hand. While bindings exist I want to use this opportunity to see just how far an agent could make the C++ experience bearable.
